# Case1-CarRental
 
This website is a case study proposed and developed by the author himself. The proposal is to create a portfolio with exposure of skills already developed on the front-end.

This is a beta version and therefore some features may be inactive.

All coding was done in HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages, with application of the Bootstrap library.
